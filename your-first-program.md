# Errors

Open your Chrome browser and type `about:blank` into the address bar. This will give you a new, blank page. Then press the `F12` key.

> #### Note::Function Keys
>
> `F12` is not the `F` key, the `1` key, and the `2` key. `F12` is just one key. It's one of the "function keys" above the number keys on your keyboard.
>
> Many laptops disable the function keys by default. You may need to hold down the `Fn` key in order to make `F12` act like a function key.
>
> The `F12` key should open a new window on the side or bottom of Chrome. If it does something else \(like changing the screen brightness, speaker volume or toggling your wireless off\), then you will need to hold down the `Fn` key, press `F12`, and then release the `Fn` key.

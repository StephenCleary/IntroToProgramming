# About Computers

Computers are everywhere!

Phones, tablets, TVs, cars, pianos, pacemakers, ... Computers are all around us. Computers can do amazing things, but even very different computers are all very similar to each other on the inside.

Computers are just _machines_. They cannot do anything by themselves; they can only follow instructions. Sometimes computers _seem_ like more than just a machine, but that's just because the computer is following its instructions _really fast_. These "instructions" that a computer obeys are called **programs**.

As a **programmer**, you give the computer programs, and the computer obeys those instructions.

Most computers have the same basic structure: CPU, transient storage, and persistent storage.

* The **CPU** \(Central Processing Unit\) is the brain of the computer. It does the actual **executing** \(obeying\) of the instructions.
* Transient storage \(commonly called **memory** or **RAM**, short for Random Access Memory\) is the temporary storage space that the CPU normally uses to store its data. RAM is very fast, but it has a drawback: the data is all erased whenever the computer turns off.
* Persistent storage \(usually a hard drive or flash drive\) is the storage space where long-term data is kept. It is much slower than RAM, but the data in persistent storage is not erased when the computer turns off.

You have probably heard that computers are all about **zeroes** and **ones**. This is completely true.

You've probably also seen TV shows and movies where the nerd stares at a string of zeroes and ones and sees some meaning in it. This is completely ridiculous.

It is true that computers only understand zeroes and ones. All storage on the hard drive is a series of zeroes and ones. All storage in the memory is a series of zeroes and ones. And when the CPU executes its instructions, those instructions are encoded as a series of zeroes and ones. It is perfectly true that computers only understand zeroes and ones.

However, people do not work well with just zeroes and ones. If programmers had to give the computer a bunch of zeroes and ones, they would all quit. That would just be too hard to do!

# About Programming

Computers only understand zeroes and ones, but people cannot work with only zeroes and ones. **Programming languages** bridge that gap.

A programming language is a way to write programs that is understandable by mortal humans. Programmers can write programs in a programming language, and then that program is _translated_ to zeroes and ones for the computer to understand. Programming languages are what allow programmers to write programs without having to deal in zeroes and ones.

The important takeaway here is that _programming languages are for people_. They're not for computers. Computers just care that it gets zeroes and ones; it doesn't care how the zeroes and ones get to it. The entire purpose of programming languages is that programmers can understand their programs, and that _other_ programmers can also understand that program.

There are many programming languages in the world. Some languages are better for some problems, and other languages are better for other problems. The language we're using in this course is **JavaScript**. This is important to know because when you look for solutions online \(which you will be doing\), you should include "JavaScript" as part of your search, so that you'll find solutions in the right language.

> #### Note::JavaScript, not Java
> There is also a programming language named Java, but you are not learning *Java*; you are learning *JavaScript*. The names are similar, but the languages are very different.

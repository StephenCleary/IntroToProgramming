# Stephen Cleary's Introduction to Programming Class

The class rules are pretty simple: show respect. In this class, I treat you as adults.

It's important to note that computer programming is a _skill_, not _knowledge_. It's very different than literature or history or math. If you miss a day of instruction in those subjects, you can usually just read the textbook and be OK. With a skill-based class like programming, it is usually more difficult to catch up by yourself if you fall behind. So, try your best not to miss any lectures.

Send me an email with your name, and I'll send out Slack channel invites.

During class, please do ask questions if anything is unclear! If you have a question, then there are probably many other people who also have the same question.
